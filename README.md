# Weather App
This is my final project for SheCodes Plus Workshop, giving me a Front End Developer Certification.
The app if hosted on Netlify: https://cocky-heisenberg-4f3b5e.netlify.app/

## Description
For live weather data I used an API from openweathermap.org.
The app is not collecting or storing any data from the user. The primary function is to display current weather data and forecast for the user's searched city or current geolocation.

## Functions
+ Search weather in a specific city or your current geolocation
+ current weather conditions (feels-like temperature, wind speed, humidity)
+ 5 day weather forecast (with maximum and minimum temperatures)
+ forecast for the next 4 hours
+ local time
+ change temperature units to celcius or farenheit
